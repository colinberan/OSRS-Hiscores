# OSRS-Hiscores

Python exploration of Old School Runescape Hiscores data gathered on July 21st, 2022. 
Two small projects here:

1. Boss kill count tracking for one particular username. When executing the code, the user is prompted for a case-sensitive OSRS username and then they are given a table of information including all bosses and that user's kill count for that boss (or a "Not listed on Hiscores." response if the kill count is too low to be registered).

2. List of all bosses with the username of the player who has the highest kill count for that particular boss as well as the number of kills that player has.

I'll likely come back to this in the future to add more as I come up with ideas for what I want to see.
